     Chickenpox</pre>
<pre style="color:DimGray;font-size:30px" >
    Overview</pre>
<pre style="color:DimGray;font-size:20px" >
	Chickenpox is an infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus. It causes an itchy rash with small, fluid-filled blisters.
	Chickenpox is highly contagious to people who haven't had the disease or been vaccinated against it. Today, a vaccine is
	available that protects children against chickenpox. Routine vaccination is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control
	and Prevention (CDC). The chickenpox vaccine is a safe, effective way to prevent chickenpox and its possible complications.</pre>

<pre style="color:DimGray;font-size:30px" >
    Symptoms</pre>

<pre style="color:DimGray;font-size:20px" >
	The itchy blister rash caused by chickenpox infection appears 10 to 21 days after exposure to the virus and usually lasts
	about five to 10 days.</pre>

<pre style="color:DimGray;font-size:20px" >
	New bumps continue to appear for several days, so you may have all three stages of the rash — bumps, blisters and scabbed
	lesions — at the same time. You can spread the virus to other people for up to 48 hours before the rash appears, and the
	virus remains contagious until all broken blisters have crusted over.</pre>

<pre style="color:DimGray;font-size:30px" >
    Causes</pre>

<pre style="color:DimGray;font-size:20px" >
	Chickenpox infection is caused by a virus. It can spread through direct contact with the rash. It can also spread
	when a person with the chickenpox coughs or sneezes and you inhale the air droplets.</pre>

<pre style="color:DimGray;font-size:30px" >
    Risk factors</pre>

<pre style="color:DimGray;font-size:20px" >
	Your risk of becoming infected with the varicella-zoster virus that causes chickenpox is higher if you haven't already
	had chickenpox or if you haven't had the chickenpox vaccine. It's especially important for people who work in child
	care or school settings to be vaccinated.</pre>

<pre style="color:DimGray;font-size:20px" >
	Most people who have had chickenpox or have been vaccinated against chickenpox are immune to chickenpox. If you've been
	vaccinated and still get chickenpox, symptoms are often milder, with fewer blisters and mild or no fever. A few people
	can get chickenpox more than once, but this is rare.</pre>
